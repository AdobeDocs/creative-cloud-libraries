# Accelerate Creativity with the Creative Cloud Libraries API

Creative Cloud Libraries are the foundation of your users' creative system, enabling element re-use across teams and documents. They manage, organize, and keep elements of your user’s creative system like colors, character styles, logos, and images for use in Creative Cloud apps and connected experiences. <br /> <br /> With the Creative Cloud Libraries API you can connect your application to Libraries and expand the reach of your user’s creative system. This helps them work more efficiently by providing access to those creative elements inside your application and connecting your application back to the Creative Cloud products.
