# Vector animation with enhancements from you.

Adobe Animate CC offers a JavaScript API (JSAPI) to script actions in the Animate UI, and the Custom Platform Support Development Kit (CPSDK) to extend the power of Animate to new platforms. With these tools, you can build extensions that make Animate do what you want: provide custom tools to supercharge the creative process, automate workflows, and more. <br /> <br /> Working in JavaScript and C++ using Adobeâ€™s Eclipse Toolkit and your favorite C++ IDE, you can build scripts and plug-ins and package them for distribution as extensions. Your extensions can be given away or sold in the [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/addons) marketplace where users can browse and install extensions. Discover the potential for enhancing and extending the capabilities of Adobe Animate.
