### Integrate with other apps

InDesign supports the Adobe Common Extensibility Platform(CEP), which lets you build scripts and panels that connect InDesign to other Adobe apps. Automate entire multi-app workflows to create documents that incorporate text, images, and media assets.

### Import, export, and process documents in XML-compatible format

Use InDesign’s IDML, an XML-based format, to manipulate documents and their contents. Process files for import and export, read and write content to databases, parse and place content where you wish.
