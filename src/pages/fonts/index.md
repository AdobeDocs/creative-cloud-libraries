# Integrate Unlimited Fonts

Build the Adobe Fonts Library into your application experience with our platform. <br /><br /> Please note we are not currently accepting new integrations while we plan updates to our documentation. Existing third-party integrations can reference existing [documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/adobe-fonts/docs.html) or [email us](mailto:fontintegrations@adobe.com) with questions.

### Publish Kits

Publish great type on the web, by building a kit of specified fonts that will load on specific domains using a simple HTML embed code. With our APIs, you can choose fonts and create kits from within your own application.

### Resolve Missing Fonts

You’ve got a file open, but not all the embedded fonts are there. Now what? Use our API to find missing fonts. We’ll match what we can with fonts from the Adobe Fonts library.
